# SS-myProject

This is a project I worked on in Computer Science 1. I worked alongside 2 of my friends in the class. We progressively worked on this project. We started with this during our midterm project.
We continued to add new material as the class went on slowly improving the code. Although we did not get to finish it to the degree we wanted to we got a long way. 
This project was meant to replicate the game galaga. We weren't able to get it to the aliens to fight back to our ship. The way to use this code is to download processing. 
Once it's downloaded you run the code and use the left and right arrow to move the ship and up to shoot the aliens. If they are hit a boom will appear. Once all are hit a victory screen will appear.
Once you are done you can press r to reset. The license I used is BSD 2-Clause License.
